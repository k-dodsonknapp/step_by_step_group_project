                    One of the main difficulty to make a split flap display with 3D printer is the fabrication of flaps. 
                    Therefore I used off-the-shelf playing cards for flaps, and made a funny and crazy clock with minimum number of parts. 
                    Simple design : each display unit consists of only 3 types of parts. Sensor is not used to find the origin. 
                    Funny motion : by arranging cards randomly, you can enjoy busy motion of flaps

                    Inspired by the launch of the James Webb Telescope on 24/12/2021, I was driven to make something to commemorate this incredible achievement, hence the James Webb Space Teleclock. The aim was to make a decorative item for the home that resembled the mirror portion of the telescope which in my opinion is not only an engineering marvel but a gorgeous one at that. Making it into a clock was just to make it functional as well :)

                    If you are interested in the 25 years of engineering that went into building the James Webb Telescope I would recommend watching this episode of Real Engineering

                    With a simple set-up, you can produce excellent photographs of birds in flight--from the comfort of your house! Birds are attractive targets for wildlife photographers. They are aesthetically pleasing, ubiquitous, and charismatic. But once one has mastered the "bird on a stick" photo, a photographer may feel challenged to produce more interesting photos. Bird in flight (BIF) photos are dramatic, but much harder to get. Some degree of chance is usually required, and a long time in the field. The method demonstrated here is relatively simple and allows one to take BIF images in the dead of winter, when birds are most drawn to feeders. Meanwhile, the photographer is warm and cozy.

                    Do you hear about bamboo dragonflies? I played it in my childhood, which kids' hands can make with a stick and long blade fixed on the top of the shaft. Kids can spin the pole with their hands to let it fly high in the air, which looks like a dragonfly. It is a fascinating toy to play with among kids' outdoor activities. This time I made it with Autodesk Tinkercad and the 3D printer.

        I’ve been into playing retro games lately and thought it would be cool to build an arcade stick (also called a “fight stick”) for use with RetroPie. 
        I had some leftover IKEA oak butcher block from a kitchen project and figured it would be a great material to use for this. 
        I love the look and the feel of it and at 1 1/8-inch thick, it’s super sturdy and solid. Also, it’s easy to treat with mineral oil to make it look nice.
